# Semi Supervised Learning with Holistic methods (SSLH)

Holistic methods for Semi-Supervised Learning : MixMatch, ReMixMatch and FixMatch for ESC-10, UrbanSound8k and GoogleSpeechCommands datasets.

[comment]: <>  (TODO : CIFAR-10 still need to be fixed)

## Installation
#### Prerequisites
- This project has been made with Ubuntu 20.04 and Python 3.8.5.
- This installation requires **Anaconda** to manage the Python environment. (version used: 4.8.5) 
- This project has been made for running with GPU but not with CPU.
- Make sure you have access to the following repositories : 
  - For UrbanSound8k dataset : https://github.com/leocances/UrbanSound8K (created by LÃ©o Cances)
  - For AudioSet dataset : https://github.com/Labbeti/Torch-AudioSet
  - For utility functions and classes : https://github.com/Labbeti/MLU

#### Download & setup
- Clone the repository :
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Labbeti/SSL
```
- Create a conda environment with the YAML file (passwords can be required during installation) :
```bash
cd SSL
conda env create -f environment.yml
```
- Activate the new environment :
```bash
conda activate env_ssl
```
- Setup the main repository :
```bash
pip install -e .
```
- Create the results folders :
```bash
mkdir -p results/models results/tensorboard
```

## Datasets
CIFAR10, ESC10 and GoogleSpeechCommands are automatically download and installed.
For UrbanSound8k, please read the [README of leocances](https://github.com/leocances/UrbanSound8K/blob/master/README.md#prepare-the-dataset), in section "Prepare the dataset". 

## Usage
The main scripts available are in folder ```standalone/``` :
- ```supervised.py```
- ```mixmatch.py```
- ```remixmatch.py```
- ```fixmatch.py```

Example :
```
cd standalone/
python mixmatch.py --dataset ESC10 --dataset_path ../dataset --lr 3e-3
```

Every script contains all the initialisation needed for start training and the train code and losses is in ```sslh/``` folder.

The ```uda.py``` training is currently unstable.
The suffix "_exp" indicate that the file contains experimental code for running variants.

## Notebook
You can find a mixmatch fast code example in a notebook [standalone/mixmatch.ipynb](https://github.com/Labbeti/SSL/blob/master/standalone/mixmatch.ipynb).
